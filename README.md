# EmailAdminApp

This is my first java github project and is based on the video by Master Skills which is linked below:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3Ibvu0htNs

## Purpose of the Project
This project is to show some basic knowledge I know within Java and demonstrate my knowledge of Java.  I intend on adding more to it over time but this is the start of it that I began working on during my 2023 Winter break.  I never used Github for committing to other repositories before and this is the first README I have wrote to such an extent so I would like to use this to understand Github and eventually use Git as well for updating this repository.  

## Key changes I did in comparison to the video
1. Lots of commenting, including Java Doc comments.
2. Exception handling for values that aren't a integer within the setDepartment method to prevent crashing.
3. For setDepartment method, I added a while loop to test if the user inputs the correct number for the department code. If they misenter it then they can
   re-enter rather than the program going on to the next task. 
4. Allowing the user to input their own first and last name.
5. Removal of set alternate email method as it was not in use.  (May implement it back later)

## Future features I would like to add
1. Update the random password generator to create a more secure password.
2. Develop the changePassword method into something that changes the password or allow the user to generate a new password.
3. Allow the program to save the data inputted by the user into something else (probably a CSV).

## Using the project
Download the two java files, compile, and run.

I really appreciate feedback and I want to get better at programming and using Github in the future.
